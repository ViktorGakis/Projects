# Overview

Through the history of trading people identified some re-occuring patterns that could be used to forecast the stock prices. For an overview and guide on these patterns one could visit [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/112601.asp#:~:text=Patterns%20are%20the%20distinctive%20formations,lows%2C%20during%20a%20specific%20period). Nowadays, there are a lot of trading libraries and packages that contain all sorts of tools. One well known and open source library which is called [ta-lib](https://ta-lib.org/) includes a wide variety of patterns encoded. 


# Goal

The goal of this project is to use the Python wrapper of ta-lib called [talib](https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/doc_index.html) in order to probe the use of patterns. To that end, we also devise a very simple and intuitive strategy in order to quantify their profitability.
