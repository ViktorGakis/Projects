# Predicting Stock Prices with Linear Regression

## We construct a Python script that uses Linear Regression to predict the Close price of a stock

### The prediction of the Close prices is realised in following ways

1. We use the Open price as the independent variable X. (Simple Linear Regression)
2. We use a combination of simple moving averages. (Linear Regression)
3. We use a combination of the most popular moving averages. (Linear Regression)

### Packages used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, sklearn, scipy, yfinance, sqlite3
